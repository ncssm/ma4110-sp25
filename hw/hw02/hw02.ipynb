Assign to this array of values to `expected_revenue`. You can read about `np.arange` as needed in this [textbook section](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/05/2/Ranges.html).\n",

For the next year you now guess there will be a revenue of 17.14 billion dollars, but there is a revenue of 19.06 billion dollars, so the error is $\\lvert 17.14 - 19.06 \\rvert$. Therefore, the average difference between your guess and the actual revenue for just the second and third years would be $$\\frac{|15.4-17.14|+ |17.14-19.06|}{2} = 1.83$$."
